Lacinia-Pedestal
================

`Lacinia <https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia>`_ is a library for implementing
Facebook's
`GraphQL <https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/05/01/graphql-introduction.html>`_
specification in idiomatic
`Clojure <http://clojure.org>`_.

This library, Lacinia-Pedestal, extends Lacinia to the web, building on the
`Pedestal <http://pedestal.io/>`_ framework.
It provides Pedestal routes and interceptors to allow GraphQL schemas to be exposed as a web endpoint, as well as
providing the `GraphIQL client <https://github.com/graphql/graphiql>`_
