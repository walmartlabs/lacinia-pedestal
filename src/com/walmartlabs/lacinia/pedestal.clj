(defn service-map
  "Creates and returns a Pedestal service map.
  This uses a server type of :jetty.

  The returned service map can be passed to the `io.pedestal.http/create-server` function.

  The deprecated function [[pedestal-service]] invokes `create-server` before returning.
  However, in many cases, further extensions to the service map are needed before
  creating and starting the server.

  `compiled-schema` may be the actual compiled schema, or a no-arguments function
  that returns the compiled schema.

  Options:

  :graphiql (default: false)
  : If given, then enables resources to support the GraphiQL IDE.
    This includes disabling the Content-Security-Policy headers
    that Pedestal 0.5.3 generates by default.

  :routes (default: via [[graphql-routes]])
  : Used when explicitly setting up the routes.
    It is significantly easier to configure the interceptors than to set up
    the routes explicitly, this option exists primarily for backwards compatibility.

  :subscriptions (default: false)
  : If enabled, then support for WebSocket-based subscriptions is added.
  : See [[listener-fn-factory]] for further options related to subscriptions.

  :path (default: \"/graphql\")
  : Path at which GraphQL requests are services (distinct from the GraphQL IDE).

  :ide-path (default: \"/\")
  : Path from which the GraphiQL IDE, if enabled, can be loaded.

  :asset-path (default: \"/assets/graphiql\")
  : Path from which the JavaScript and CSS assets may be loaded.

  :ide-headers
  : A map from header name to header value. Keys and values may be strings, keywords,
    or symbols and are converted to strings using clojure.core/name.
    These define additional headers to be included in the requests from the IDE.
    Typically, the headers are used to identify and authenticate the requests.

  :interceptors
  : A seq of interceptors to be used in GraphQL routes; passed to [[routes-from-interceptors]].
    If not provided, [[default-interceptors]] is invoked.

  :query-store
  : A function that supports server-side queries.
    The GraphQL query name extracted from the request is provided to the function, which may
    return a stored query (if found), or nil if no query with the given name exists.

  :query-cache
  : A cache, used for in-memory caching of the parsed queries.
    Only named server-side queries obtained via the query-store are cached.

    A cache is an instance of clojure.core.cache/CacheProtocol.

    The default cache is a TTL cache with a 10 minute expiration.
    This is very likely incorrect for your application and should be overridden.

    When the compiled schema is provided as a function (typically, during REPL-oriented development),
    the query cache TTL should be very short, otherwise the parsed query may be cached with an old version
    of the schema even after the schema has changed.

  :get-enabled (default true)
  : If true, then a route for the GET method is included. GET requests include the query
    as the `query` query parameter, and can't specify variables or an operation name.

  :async (default: false)
  : If true, the query will execute asynchronously; the handler will return a clojure.core.async
    channel rather than blocking.

  :app-context
  : The base application context provided to Lacinia when executing a query.

  :subscriptions-path (default: \"/graphql-ws\")
  : If subscriptions are enabled, the path at which to service GraphQL websocket requests.
    This must be a distinct path (not the same as the main path or the GraphiQL IDE path).

  :port (default: 8888)
  : HTTP port to use.

  :env (default: :dev)
  : Environment being started.

  See further notes in [[graphql-routes]] and [[default-interceptors]]."
